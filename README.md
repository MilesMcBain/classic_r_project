# A classic R project

This is an example of a classic R project. It is intended to be somewhat representative of 'real world' use of R, but it is in no way an interesting analysis.

It features:
  - Staged pipeline scripts with the leading number convention to indicate execution order
  - Mashing up data from multiple sources including an API and disk
  - Saving plots to disk as images
  - Duplicated constants and library() calls
  - Long running modelling process
  - Model diagnostics
  - An Rmarkdown report output
